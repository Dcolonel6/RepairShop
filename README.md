# Repair Shop
### By Dennis Njogu

## Description
The project is meant to capture activities and processes taking place in a phone repair shop. It captures process
such as booking and consequently creation of tickets, how technicians(in the project they identify as users) are assigned to these
tickets.
The project is simplistic and shouldnt be used in a real world scenario.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites
Apart from having a browser, you should install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Any version of node from v16 should be fine. 
Additionally you will need npm for dependancy management, luckily nodejs comes bundled with the package manager. 
NPM version 8.0.0 and above will suffice.

### Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repo to the local machine
2. Cd into the folder named repair-shop from your terminal
3. Install dependancies by running `npm install`
4. After the installs have completed run `npm start` to spin a local dev server that will serve this application locally.
5. You will need internet connection as resources are being fetched from a remote server accessible [here](https://backend-repair-shop.herokuapp.com/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
